<p>
  Have you been carrying a lot of loot lately?  DIM v3.5.1 has a significant
  QoL change where it will clear the way for transfers automatically if you have
  full vault or inventories. This means you spend less time in our app and more time playing. <3
<p>Multiple item moves and loadouts will now wait for each to complete sequentially
  to prevent errors from occurring if the vault was full.
<p>We've saved several seconds when applying loadouts by equipping and dequipping
  all items at once.</p>
