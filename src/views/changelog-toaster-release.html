  <p>v4.38.0</p>
  <ul class="changelog-toaster">
<li>Fixed display of Clan XP milestone.</li>
<li>DIM's logic to automatically move aside items to make room for what you're moving is smarter - it'll leave put things you just moved, and it'll prefer items you've tagged as favorites.</li>
<li>In D2, "Make room for Postmaster" has been replaced with "Collect Postmaster" which pulls all postmaster items we can onto your character. You can still make room by clicking "Space".</li>
<li>Fix pull from postmaster to clear exactly enough space, not too many, but also not too few.</li>
<li>Accounts with no characters will no longer show up in the account dropdown.</li>
<li>Item tagging via keyboard should be a little more international-friendly. Calling the help menu (via shift+/) is too.</li>
<li>Fixed XP required for well-rested perk after the latest Destiny update.</li>
  </ul>
