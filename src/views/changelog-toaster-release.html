    <li>Vendors now show where they are, and are sorted better. All the cryptarchs now appear. Engrams waiting to be decrypted aren't shown in the vendor screen.</li>
    <li>Style updates to clean up DIM's look and make sure more screen space is being used for items.</li>
    <li>The "Hide Unfiltered Items while Filtering" preference now applies to vendor gear too.</li>
