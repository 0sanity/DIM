# 3.2.1

* Crimson Days theme.
* Weapons and armor now show all activated perks (including scopes, etc), in the same order they are shown in the game.
* Only display the "more info" detail icon if there's something to show.
* If you try to move an item into a full inventory, we'll reload to see if you've already made space in the game, rather than failing the move immediately.
* The Infusion dialog now has a "Maximize Attack/Defense" button that figures out how to get the highest stats with the fewest number of infusions.
* You can now create a loadout based on what you've got equipped by selecting "From Equipped" in the "Create Loadout" menu item.
* After applying a loadout, a new pseudo-loadout called "Before 'Your Loadout'" appears that will put back the items you had equipped.

# 3.2

* In the "Loadouts" dropdown is a new "Maximize Light" auto-loadout that does what it says, pulling items from all your characters and the vault in order to maximize your character's light.
* Lots of performance improvements! Loading DIM, refreshing, moving items, and searching should all be faster.
* DIM will now refresh immediately when you switch back to its tab, or come back from screensaver, etc. It won't automatically update when it's in the background anymore. It still periodically updates itself when it is the focused tab.
* New "is:year1" and "is:year2" search filters.
* Artifacts now have the right class type (hunter, titan, etc).
* The reload and settings icons are easier to hit (remember you can also hit "R" to reload.
* The move popup closes immediately when you select a move, rather than waiting for the move to start.
* New sort option of "rarity, then primary stat".
