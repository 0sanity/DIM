First, thank you for contributing to DIM! We're a community-driven project and we appreciate improvements large and small.

Here are some tips to make sure your pull request can be merged smoothly:

1. If you want to add a feature or make some change to DIM, consider [filing an issue](https://github.com/DestinyItemManager/DIM/issues/new) describing your idea first. This will give the DIM community a chance to discuss the idea, offer suggestions and pointers, and make sure what you're thinking of fits with the style and direction of DIM. If you want a more free-form chat, [join our Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/UK2GWC7).
1. Resist the temptation to change more than one thing in your PR. Keeping PRs focused on a single change makes them much easier to review and accept. If you want to change multiple things, or clean up/refactor the code, make a new branch and submit those changes as a separate PR.
1. You can use any ES6/ES2015 features - we use Babel to compile out any features too new for browsers. We are also encouraging developers to write new code in [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) and to use React instead of AngularJS where possible.
1. Take advantage of the [native JavaScript Array methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) and the [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org) library to write compact, easy-to-understand code.
1. Be sure to run `yarn run lint` before submitting your PR - it'll catch most style problems and make things much easier to merge.
1. Don't forget to add a description of your change to `CHANGELOG.md` so it'll be included in the release notes!

## Developer Quick start
Clone the repo:

* `git clone https://github.com/DestinyItemManager/DIM.git`

Install dependencies:

* Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/).
* Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install). If you're used to NPM, see "[Migrating from NPM](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/migrating-from-npm/)". If you were already using NPM with DIM, run `yarn` to convert to Yarn. 
* Windows-based developers will need to install `windows-build-tools` (`yarn global add windows-build-tools`) globally prior to running `yarn install`. Refer to issue #1439 for [details](https://github.com/DestinyItemManager/DIM/issues/1439).
* Linux-based developers will need to install `build-essential` (`sudo apt-get install -y build-essential`) prior to runninng `yarn install`.
* Run `yarn install`.
  * Note that on Windows, the Git Bash shell may fail to fetch all necessary packages even when run as Admin ([details](https://github.com/DestinyItemManager/DIM/issues/2487)). If that's the case, simply use cmd as Admin instead.
* It is highly recommended to use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to work on DIM. When you open DIM in VSCode, accept the recommended plugins it suggests.

Check code Style
* `yarn lint` will tell you if you're following the DIM code style (and automatically fix what it can).

## Docker Compose Setup
Install Dependencies, start webpack, and start local web server, with Docker
* Install Docker https://www.docker.com/get-started
* Open terminal/cmd/powershell window and change to the cloned folder
* `docker-compose up` to build the dist and start yarn watcher
* It will take a while for the dist files to build on the first startup while yarn installs dependencies
* `ctrl+c` to stop
* `docker-compose up -d` to start in detached mode
* `docker-compose stop` to stop detached mode
* `docker-compose build` to re-build if the compose files change

Get your own API key:

1. Goto [Bungie](https://www.bungie.net/en/Application)
1. Click `Create New App`
1. Enter any application name, and `https://github.com/YourGithubUsername/DIM`
1. For `Oauth Client type` select `Confidential`
1. Set your redirect url to `https://127.0.0.1:8080/return.html` (or whatever the IP or hostname is of your dev server)
1. Select all scopes _except_ the Administrate Groups/Clans
1. Enter `https://127.0.0.1:8080` as the `Origin Header`
1. Run `yarn install && yarn start`
1. Copy your API-key, Oauth Client_id, and OAuth client_secret from bungie.net into DIM developer settings panel when it is loaded.
